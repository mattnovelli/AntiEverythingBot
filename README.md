# AntiEverythingBot
A Twitter Bot that hates everything.

## You will need to install the **[Tweepy library](https://www.tweepy.org/)** in order for this code to work.

This is a very straightforward Twitter Bot. When run, the bot will take a random emoji from "emojis.py", check if it has been used in "used.txt", and then combine it with two unicode symbols -- the cross-through symbol and an invisible character that will overlap the two.

### Getting Started (and finished)
Ensure you have the [Tweepy library](https://www.tweepy.org/) installed.

Put your four Twitter API keys in the blank variables named C_KEY, C_SECRET, A_TOKEN, and A_TOKEN_SECRET at the top of antieverything.py. Keep these keys secret! After this, you should be good to go.

Please note that this code uses some funky Unicode characters that may not display properly in all IDEs or consoles.

Thank you to [@mioog](https://twitter.com/mioog) on Twitter for discovering the Unicode exploit.
