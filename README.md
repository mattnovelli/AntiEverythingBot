# AntiEverythingBot
A Twitter Bot that hated everything.

## What it do?
In February of 2019 Twitter user [@mioog](https://twitter.com/mioog) (NSFW) discovered a Unicode character that allowed one character to overlap another. The ['anti-LGBT' emoji was born](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/anti-lgbt-emoji-twitter-gay-pride-flag-homphobic-viral-a8787686.html), depicting a pride flag with a "prohibited sign" over it. **AntiEverythingBot** *was* a Twitter bot that aimed to dilute the meaning behind the fauxmoji by flooding Twitter with alternate anti-emojis. Dealing with an empty unicode character ***AND*** emojis in my code is not something I want to do again.
